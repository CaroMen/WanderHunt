## Wander Hunt

Wander Hunt is a clone of Product Hunt, a website where people share and discover new products. Our take was to create a website where users could share their adventures for people to see and learn of new experiences/adventures to take.

#### Wander Hunt Technologies

Wander Hunt was created using JavaScript, Express, postgreSQL, PugJS, and Heroku.
